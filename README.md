![Robot](/Calliope.jpg)

This repository contains Team 841's robot code for the 2024 season. This is the first time Team 841 ran swerve in an on-season competition. The code implements PathPlanner for autonomous routines and WPILib's Command-Based Programming for robot control.

The robot code was rewritten using AdvantageKit for the offseason, the link to the repo here: [link](https://github.com/Team841/CalliopeAK).
